# P-Happy-Good-Habits-
A program that predicts cognitive performance based on lifestyle habits.

**The motivation:**
As students, we often find it challenging to balance our health with the rigorous demands of coursework. Neglecting our body’s signals, whether it’s skipping sleep, overloading on caffeine, or ignoring stress can backfire, ultimately impairing our ability to focus in class and perform at our full potential. By prioritizing our well-being, we can not only improve our academic performance but also foster a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle.

**How it works:**
The program begins by collecting basic demographic information, such as age and gender, which is securely stored locally. Users then input their daily lifestyle habits—such as caffeine consumption, sleep duration, exercise hours, and screen time. Using this data, the program analyzes patterns and generates a personalized prediction of the user’s cognitive performance, mood, and stress levels. 
This insight helps users understand how their habits may be influencing their mental well-being and productivity.
